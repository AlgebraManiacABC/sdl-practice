# sdl-practice
A workspace for me to practice with the SDL2 libraries

## Folders:

### Sand
This program is a falling sand game I created to learn more about drawing rectangles with SDL2. It was a huge success! I'm quite proud of it. (It has been my first foray into SDL2)
```
Controls:

Mouse: Target a location (shown with transparent square)

1,2,3,0: Material selection (Sand, Water, Wood, Erase, respectively)

Left click: Add selected material at targeted location
Right click: Remove material at targeted location
```
